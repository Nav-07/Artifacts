# Artifacts
Artifacts is a 2D Open-World Game where the player has the task of finding in-game hidden stuff, 12 hidden boxes(I dont have the time to make art), Each box is white in colour and the player is rectangle, the code is free to use(though credits to me would be appreciated), other than that have fun playing this game.

## Why did you even made something so bad? How did you even manage to do such a thing?
The Reason this game is so bad, is because I made it bad, the main goal I was trying to piull out was to make something that is basically art-less but, is fun, able to drive the person of his work and basically lightweight and able to run on a mac.

I have listed the development tools I used to develop this bad game and some alternatives to them as well.

## Tools
1. C++ : Programming Language of Choice: Alternatives: C, Python(Pygame), etc.
2. SDL2: Graphics Framework(Made on top of OpenGL): Alternatives: Pygame(for Python)
3. XCode: IDE: Alternatives: Sublime Text(with Terminal(if you want to be a gangster))

These are all the tools that I used to pull of something this bad.
