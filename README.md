# Artifacts
Artifacts is a 2D Open-World Game where the player has the task of finding in-game hidden stuff, 12 hidden boxes(I dont have the time to make art), Each box is white in colour and the player is rectangle, the code is free to use(though credits to me would be appreciated), other than that have fun playing this game.

### Nav, Why did you even make this shit?
I made this shit because I was bored on a saturday morning, thinking of why cats are so boring... This shit would help me clear the shit in my previous code which is already very shit.

Ok Nav, Enough of swearing, let's move on.
